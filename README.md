# js-orderbook-canvas
This is a CS50 final project codebase.

## Vanilla HTML
For CS50 final project purposes - primarily to maintain CS50's low-level spirit, this will be a vanilla html project. This is a little orderbook "template/widget" written with js and canvas. The orderbook is often used by traders for analysing orders and liquidity.

## Technology
At first I was thinking of using SVG (with D3js), however, upon inspecting other webapps for similar purposes (stock trading and the like) it appears that, instead of SVG, they utilise canvas. Therefore, this final-project will not just be a reiteration of things I have previously learned from this course or otherwise, but that It will also be a challenge for myself to learn something new - HTML5 Canvas. I will be mostly using the MDN documentation for it. Furthermore, as well stated above, this will, of course be, vanilla html.
